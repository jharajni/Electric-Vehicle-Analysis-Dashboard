# Electric-Vehicle-Analysis-Dashboard
Problem Statement:
To effectively analyze and understand the electric vehicle (EV) market landscape, it is imperative to gather comprehensive Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and visualize pertinent data through various charts. The KPIs include assessing the total number of EVs, understanding the average electric range, and identifying the proportion of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) within the dataset. Additionally, visualization through charts such as Line/Area, Map, Bar, Pie/Donut, and Tree map will offer insights into the growth pattern, geographical distribution, market dominance of manufacturers, eligibility for incentives, and consumer preferences within the EV market. This comprehensive analysis aims to provide stakeholders with actionable insights for strategic decision-making and fostering the adoption of electric vehicles.

Proposed Solution: Power BI's robust features, including data integration, advanced analytics, and interactive visualizations, make it an ideal solution for addressing the complexities of analyzing and understanding the electric vehicle market landscape. By leveraging Power BI, stakeholders can gain comprehensive insights into the EV market, enabling informed decisions and driving the transition towards sustainable transportation solutions.
